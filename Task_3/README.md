# Task 3 - Sales Prediction
The project is a predictive analysis of sales based on advertising spending using linear regression. The data used for the analysis consists of information about advertising spending in three different media types - TV, radio, and newspaper - and the corresponding sales data.

The aim of the project is to understand the relationship between advertising spending and sales and build a linear regression model that can accurately predict the sales based on the amount spent on different media types.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training and evaluation, and finally using the trained model to make predictions on new data. The project also includes various visualizations such as scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, and pairplots to help understand the data better and make informed decisions.

The project can be useful for companies or organizations that want to optimize their advertising spending and predict the expected sales based on the spending. The trained linear regression model can be integrated into a website or an application to provide real-time sales predictions based on the current advertising spending.
