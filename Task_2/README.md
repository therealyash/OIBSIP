# Task 2 - Email Spam Detection
Email spam detection is a common problem in the field of data science and machine learning. In this project, we aim to build a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not spam. We have used three different algorithms - Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Gaussian Naive Bayes - to train our model. After evaluating the performance of each algorithm, we found that the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm achieved the best results with a precision of 1 and an accuracy of 97%. This project showcases the power of machine learning in tackling real-world problems such as email spam detection.
